Environment
•	Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
•	Language: Python 3.6.9

Instructions:
•	Make sure “client.py”, “server.py”, “packet.py”, and the image file to be sent are all saved in the same directory.
•	When within the directory using the terminal run “./server.py”, and in a second terminal run “./client.py”
•	In the second terminal in which “./client.py” was ran, the program will prompt the user to enter the name of the image to be sent.
•	Subsequently the program will display information about the image files and how it was split into packets and prompt the user to input the name under which the server should save the image once it has received it.
•	The server will remain active waiting for further client messages. To terminate the server process, type Ctrl+C into the terminal in which it is running.
•	Finally, open the new image saved under the name input in the previous step to verify absence of packet loss.
